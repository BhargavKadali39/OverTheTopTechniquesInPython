# OverTheTopTechniquesInPython
Simplifying commonly used techniques for more optimized representation.

Python is a God's boon for the programmer's who belong to c,c++,java background.
Similarly very easy to learn if you're trying to learn programming as a beginner.

You would've already figured out what's the purpose of this repo,  
yes it's about simplified approaches toward daily use case techniques and methodology.  
I've previously posted some repository's regarding the similar use case like  
* [swapping-numbers](https://github.com/BhargavKadali39/Swapping_in_python)  
* [pattern-printing ](https://github.com/BhargavKadali39/Pattern-printing-in-python) which consists of a total 6 repos as per today (day this repo is posted).
* [Removing duplicates from a list](https://github.com/BhargavKadali39/Python_Data_Structure_Cheat_Sheet) program inside the given python file.  
BTW you can check out the Python_Data_Structure_Cheat_Sheet created by me for more detailed view of how they work.

Let's get to the topics I covered in this repo,
# concatenating strings
# string reverse
# combining lists using ZIP() function
# list to dict using zip()
# The _ operator
# Multiple user input
# The Walrus(:=) operator
# Passing N no.of arguments in a function
# passing values into tuples
*

<h2>concatenating strings</h2>
When we take input from user and store every char as a seperate element in a list we don't have to use a loop to join them all.
using join() command we can achieve that easily
